## Implementation Challenges & Mitigations

### AR Precision
**Challenge**: Accurate placement of AR markers based on geolocation
**Mitigation**: Implement calibration system and fallback to map view when precision is low

### Voice Recognition in Noisy Environments
**Challenge**: Reduced accuracy in outdoor or noisy settings
**Mitigation**: Implement noise filtering and provide text input alternative

### Battery Consumption
**Challenge**: AR and location services drain battery quickly
**Mitigation**: Optimize rendering, implement battery-saving mode, reduce polling frequency

### Data Connectivity
**Challenge**: Inconsistent connectivity affecting API calls
**Mitigation**: Implement offline mode with cached partner data and deferred synchronization

### Privacy Concerns
**Challenge**: Handling sensitive health and location data
**Mitigation**: Clear permission flows, local processing where possible, transparent data policies

## Success Metrics

- **Engagement**: Time spent in AR view, number of voice commands used
- **Discovery**: Number of partners viewed, variety of partners engaged
- **Health Impact**: Progress on health goals, completion of recommended actions
- **Usability**: Task completion rate, error rate, user satisfaction scores
