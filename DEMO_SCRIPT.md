# DiscoveryLens+ Demo Script

## Introduction (30 seconds)

**[Slide: DiscoveryLens+ Logo]**

"Today, we're excited to introduce DiscoveryLens+, an innovative solution that transforms how Discovery clients engage with Vitality benefits through the power of Augmented Reality and Voice AI."

**[Slide: Problem Statement]**

"Many Vitality members struggle to discover nearby benefits and navigate complex health services, especially on-the-go. Traditional app interfaces require multiple taps and navigation steps, creating friction in the user experience."

## Concept Overview (1 minute)

**[Slide: Solution Overview]**

"DiscoveryLens+ solves this by combining AR visualization with voice interaction to create an immersive assistant that helps clients engage with Vitality benefits in their surroundings."

**[Slide: Key Features]**

"The app has four core capabilities:
1. AR visualization of nearby Vitality partners
2. Voice-powered navigation and queries
3. Personal Health Pathways integration
4. Automated task handling for bookings and reminders"

## Demo Walkthrough (3 minutes)

### Part 1: AR Visualization

**[Demo: Home Screen â†’ AR View]**

"Let me show you how it works. When you open DiscoveryLens+, you're greeted with a simple interface. Tapping the AR button activates your camera view."

**[Demo: AR View showing nearby partners]**

"Now you can see the world around you with Vitality partners highlighted through AR markers. Each marker is color-coded by category - red for fitness, blue for health, and green for food partners."

"Notice how the markers show the distance and available Vitality points at a glance. This makes it incredibly easy to discover opportunities around you."

### Part 2: Voice Interaction

**[Demo: Voice Assistant Activation]**

"Now, let's try using voice commands. I'll tap the microphone button and ask:"

*"Show me healthy food options nearby"*

**[Demo: AR view highlighting food partners]**

"The assistant responds by highlighting all healthy food partners in the area and providing a voice response with relevant information."

*"I found 3 healthy food partners within 500 meters. The closest is Healthy Food Market, 150 meters away."*

"This hands-free interaction is perfect for on-the-go discovery, especially when walking or driving."

### Part 3: Partner Engagement

**[Demo: Selecting a partner marker]**

"When I tap on a partner marker, I get detailed information about that location, including:"

"The available Vitality points, distance and walking time, and options to view more details or get directions."

**[Demo: Navigation view]**

"If I choose to navigate, the app provides AR-guided directions, with arrows and turn-by-turn instructions overlaid on the real world."

### Part 4: Health Pathways Integration

**[Demo: "For You" filter]**

"One of the most powerful features is the integration with Personal Health Pathways. When I select the 'For You' filter, the app highlights partners that align with my specific health goals."

**[Demo: Voice command for health recommendations]**

*"What should I focus on today based on my health goals?"*

"The assistant analyzes my health profile and provides personalized recommendations:"

*"Based on your health goals and recent activity, I recommend visiting Wellness Clinic for your annual health check. It's been 11 months since your last one, and you'll earn 200 Vitality points."*
