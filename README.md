# DiscoveryLens+

## Project Overview
DiscoveryLens+ is an AR and voice-enabled assistant that helps Discovery clients engage with Vitality benefits through an immersive, hands-free experience. The app allows users to visualize nearby partner locations, interact through natural voice commands, and receive personalized health recommendations.

## üåê Live Demo
Check out our [live demo page](https://bhekumusaeric.github.io/DiscoveryGradHack/) to see the project concept and mockups.

## üöÄ Project Concept
DiscoveryLens+ combines Augmented Reality with Voice AI to create an immersive assistant that helps clients engage with Vitality benefits:
- Open your camera to see nearby partner locations visually marked in real-time
- Use voice commands like "Where can I earn Vitality points near me?"
- Let the assistant handle routine tasks like checking point balances or booking appointments
- Receive personalized recommendations based on your health goals through Personal Health Pathways integration

## üîç Problem Statement
Clients struggle to discover nearby Vitality benefits and navigate complex health services, especially on-the-go or for elderly users. The traditional app-based interface requires multiple taps and navigation steps, creating friction in the user experience.

## üí° Solution
Our solution transforms how users interact with Vitality benefits by leveraging cutting-edge technology:
- **AR Visualization**: See partner locations through your camera view
- **Voice Assistant**: Natural language interaction for queries and commands
- **Health Pathways**: Personalized recommendations based on health goals
- **Task Automation**: Simplified booking and engagement process
