## Creating Mockups

For the hackathon, we recommend using the following tools:
- **Figma/Adobe XD** - For UI mockups and interactive prototypes
- **draw.io/Lucidchart** - For technical diagrams and user flows
- **Canva** - For presentation slides

## Demo Video Production

For the demo video:
1. Create screen recordings of the interactive prototype
2. Use video editing software to add AR overlays
3. Record voice-over explaining the features
4. Add captions and annotations to highlight key points

## Presentation Slides

The presentation deck should include:
- Title slide with project name and team
- Problem statement with statistics
- Solution overview with key features
- Technology stack
- Demo video or live demo
- Mockup screens
- Future roadmap
- Q&A slide

## Notes for Designers

When creating mockups:
- Use Discovery brand colors and design guidelines
- Ensure AR elements are clearly visible against different backgrounds
- Design for both light and dark mode
- Consider accessibility in color choices and text sizes
- Show different states (loading, error, success) for key interactions
