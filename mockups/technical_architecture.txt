## Data Flow

1. User opens app and authenticates via Firebase Auth
2. App loads user profile and preferences from User Repository
3. Location Service gets user's current location
4. Partner Repository retrieves nearby partners based on location
5. AR Service places markers in AR space based on partner locations
6. User interacts with AR view or activates Voice Assistant
7. Voice Service captures speech and sends to Whisper API
8. Command is processed by GPT-4 API to determine intent
9. Business logic layer processes the intent and generates a response
10. UI is updated based on the response (AR markers, voice response, etc.)
11. Actions (bookings, check-ins, etc.) are processed by relevant services
12. Data changes are persisted to repositories and synced with backend

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Use of React Native's performance best practices
- Efficient AR rendering to minimize battery drain
- Optimized location tracking with appropriate intervals
- Caching strategies for API responses and partner data

### Offline Capabilities
- Local storage of essential partner data
- Offline voice command processing for basic queries
- Deferred synchronization when connectivity is restored
- Graceful degradation of features in offline mode

### Security
- Secure authentication via Firebase
- Encryption of sensitive health data
- Secure API communication with HTTPS
- Permission-based access to device features

### Scalability
- Modular architecture for easy feature addition
- Service-based design for component isolation
- Repository pattern for data source abstraction
- Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
