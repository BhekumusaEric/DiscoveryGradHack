DATA FLOW:
1. User opens app and grants camera/location permissions
2. App gets user location and fetches nearby partners from backend
3. AR view displays partners as AR markers in camera view
4. User speaks query to voice assistant
5. Voice captured and sent to Whisper API for transcription
6. Transcribed text sent to GPT-4 for intent recognition
7. Backend processes intent and queries relevant APIs
8. Response formatted and returned to client
9. Voice assistant provides audio response
10. AR view updates to highlight relevant partners
11. User interactions logged for personalization

SECURITY LAYERS:
- Firebase Authentication
- HTTPS for all API calls
- Secure token handling
- Permission-based access control
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
