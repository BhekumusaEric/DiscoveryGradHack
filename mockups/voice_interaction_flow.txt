## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

For the hackathon prototype, we'll implement a limited set of voice commands using:

1. **React Native Voice** for audio capture
2. **OpenAI Whisper API** for speech-to-text conversion
3. **GPT-4** for natural language understanding and response generation
4. **Expo Speech** for text-to-speech output

The voice assistant will be integrated with the AR view to create a seamless experience where voice commands can control what's displayed in the AR view, and the AR view can provide visual feedback for voice interactions.
