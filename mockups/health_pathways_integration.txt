```

When the "For You" filter is selected, the AR view highlights partners that align with the user's health pathway:

- **Priority Highlighting**: Partners that address immediate health needs are highlighted with a special glow effect
- **Recommendation Badges**: Special badges appear on partners that are specifically recommended based on health goals
- **Personalized Point Boosts**: Partners offering bonus points based on the user's health pathway are marked with a special indicator
- **Goal Progress Indicators**: Shows how visiting a partner will contribute to specific health goals
- **Time-Sensitive Recommendations**: Urgent health actions (like upcoming screenings) get priority highlighting

### Voice Assistant Health Integration

The voice assistant leverages health pathway data to provide personalized responses:

1. **User**: "What should I focus on today?"
   **Assistant**: "Based on your health goals and recent activity, I recommend visiting Wellness Clinic for your annual health check. It's been 11 months since your last one, and you'll earn 200 Vitality points."

2. **User**: "How am I doing on my fitness goal?"
   **Assistant**: "You've completed 3 out of 5 recommended workouts this week. Discovery Gym is 250 meters away and offers classes that align with your fitness preferences."

3. **User**: "What healthy food options match my diet?"
   **Assistant**: "I found 2 nearby partners that offer plant-based options matching your vegetarian preference. Healthy Food Market is closest and has items that would help with your nutrition goal."

+-------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Health Journey screen provides:

- **Progress Timeline**: Visual representation of the user's health journey with completed and upcoming milestones
- **Achievement Badges**: Recognition for completed health actions and goals
- **Next Best Actions**: Prioritized list of recommended health actions based on the user's profile
- **Partner Connections**: Direct links between health recommendations and nearby Vitality partners
- **Point Opportunities**: Clear indication of points available for completing recommended actions

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

For the hackathon prototype, we'll implement a simplified version of the Health Pathways integration:

1. **Mock Health Profile**: Create a simulated health profile with goals, metrics, and recommendations
2. **Personalized AR Filter**: Implement a "For You" filter that highlights partners based on the mock health profile
3. **Basic Voice Integration**: Add health-related voice commands that provide personalized recommendations
4. **Simple Recommendation Engine**: Create a basic algorithm that matches partners to health goals

The full implementation would connect to Discovery's Health Pathways API to access real user health data and provide truly personalized recommendations based on clinical insights and health journey information.
